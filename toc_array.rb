# Table of contents. Here’s something for you to do in order to play
# around more with center, ljust, and rjust: write a program that will
# display a table of contents so that it looks like this:

# 	
# Chapter 1: Getting Started page 1
# Chapter 2: Numbers page 9
# Chapter 3: Letters page 13

# Table of contents, revisited. Rewrite your table of contents program
# on page 36. Start the program with an array holding all of
# the information for your table of contents (chapter names, page
# numbers, and so on). Then print out the information from the
# array in a beautifully formatted table of contents
